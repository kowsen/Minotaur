# Minotaur
A simple, bare bones Entity Component System for C#. The goal isn't to be the most performant or memory efficient ecs in the world. It's just to make one performant and expandable enough for my relatively simple Monogame projects, and to help me learn how best to utilize an ecs by building one up myself.

Minotaur contains the ECS library. It follows the Artemis model of Components being pure data and Systems doing all the work.

The sample folder contains a sample Android and Windows project using the Minotaur framework, with the bulk of the logic shared in SampleLogic.
